# Hackathon 1 - Python, ETL and Visualisation

Hackathon 1 is an indivdual formative assesment focused on Python, ETL and Data Visualisation. Various skills will be exercised throughout the project such as data extraction, transformation, loading and data visualisation using Python tools. 

## Dataset Content

This dataset holds anonymised healthcare information regarding individual demographics, location-based variables and medical insurance costs. it aims to offers insights into how the variables contribute to variations in medical costs. 

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

Individuals with a higher BMI, family size and smoking habits will have higher medical insurance charges. 

## Project Plan

### Objectives

* To explore the relationship between personal attributes and geographic factors with healthcare insurance.
* To Extract, Transform and Load the data to ensure it's ready to be analysed.
