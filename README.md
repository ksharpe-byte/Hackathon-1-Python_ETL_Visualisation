# Hackathon 1 - Python, ETL and Visualisation

Hackathon 1 is an indivdual formative assesment focused on Python, ETL and Data Visualisation. Various skills will be exercised throughout the project such as data extraction, transformation, loading and data visualisation using Python tools. 

## Dataset Content

This dataset holds anonymised healthcare information regarding individual demographics, location-based variables and medical insurance costs. It aims to offer insights into how the variables contribute to variations in medical costs. 

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

Individuals with a higher BMI, family size and smoking habits will have higher medical insurance charges, as a stronger correlation will be displayed for those variables.

## Project Plan

### Objectives

* To explore the relationship between personal attributes and geographic factors with healthcare insurance.
* To Extract, Transform and Load the data to ensure it's ready to be analysed.
* To develop visualisations that highlight key insights such as correlations.

### Methodology

* Initial data collection will be done by downloading a dataset, extracting it from a zip file and loading it as a csv file in VS code.
* The loaded dataset will be cleaned in VS code to ensure it is analysis ready & will produce accurate insights. Python code will be used in the Pandas and NumPy libraries. 
* The cleaned dataset will be analysed using Python code in Pandas DataFrames and visualised using Python code in Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. 

Establishing and defining clear objectives guarantee's the analysis stays focused and guides the process. ETL process is followed to ensure all raw data is tranformed into a clean, accurate, complete and usable state. Data visualisation is a great way to translate complex results into clear and intuitive insights. Accurate and comprehensive data visualisation is imperitive when communication key findings to non-technical stakeholders.
